For multiple playlists, we would make the playlist_id no longer a foreign key referencing the user_id,
but rather there would be a new column titled user_id that isn't unique.  When creating a new playlist,
the playlist table will create a new item for that playlist with the next available playlist_id and fills
in the columns with necessary information.  If a playlist is updated, then the table is updated accordingly
(remove is simple, add creates a new item with proper ids and rank, rank update replaces rank numbers)

For account types, the user table will be updated with a "type" column that has datatype TINYINT.
0 - free
1 - standard
2 - premium
etc.
Probably also set a trigger so that there is a maximum value to this column (level 255 doesn't exist).
